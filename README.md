## PICOEMU

This is the repository for my implementation of a PICO-8 Emulator!
 
It keeps the memory layout but without the CPU and memory limits so that we can expand on PICO-8 games as much as we want to \o/

If you find a bug, want something to change or would like to add a feature, you can create a bug of send me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MatheusMortatti)! Feel free to create pull requests after the bug or feature is discussed!
